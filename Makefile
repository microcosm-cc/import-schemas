# Targets:
#
#   all:          Builds the code locally after testing
#
#   fmt:          Formats the source files
#   build:        Builds the code locally
#   vet:          Vets the code
#   lint:         Runs lint over the code (you do not need to fix everything)
#   test:         Runs the tests
#   clean:        Deletes the built file (if it exists)
#
#   install:      Builds, tests and installs the code locally

# Sub-directories containing code to be vetted or linted
CODE = accounting config walk

# The first target is always the default action if `make` is called without args
# We clean, build and install into $GOPATH so that it can just be run
